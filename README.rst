LCPU is a simple Lisp-like language that compiles to optimized DCPU-16
assembly code. It is a very restricted subset of Lisp. There is no GC,
and thus no data structures or run-time closures.

This is intended for usage in Mojang's next game, `0x10c <http://0x10c.com/>`_.

* Example program: https://github.com/jlongster/dcpu-lisp/blob/master/examples/print-number.l
* Generated assembly: https://github.com/jlongster/dcpu-lisp/blob/master/examples/print-number.asm
* Watch it run here: http://0x10co.de/imq63

High-level Assembly
-------------------

Think of it as a light wrapper around the assembly code, providing
named variables, lexically-bound closures, and a little bit of helpful
magic here and there.

Create a function like so::

    (define (foo x)
      (+ x 1))

Variable references are statically referenced and compiled out
straight to registers. In one function, you are not allowed more
variable definitions than there are registers (7, and the 8th is used
for the return value).

Nested functions are allowed::

    (define (foo x)
      (define (bar y)
        (+ x y))
      (bar 10))

Run-time closures are not available because of the lack of GC, so the
closed function cannot out-live its parent (you can't return ``bar``).

Only 2 kinds of values exist: functions and 16-bit numbers.

There is a lot more we could do to enrich the language but still keep
provable semantics statically.

It is written in Outlet, a Lisp that compiled to Javascript, so the
compiler can run in browser. See https://github.com/jlongster/outlet.
The js is packaged with the project so you can run it with Node.

Features
--------

* Named functions and variables
* Nested functions
* Inlinable arithmetic expressions
* Inline assembly
* Macros
* Small standard library
* Probably other stuff I've forgotten about

Does Not Have
-------------

* Garbage Collector
* Heap
* Run-time closures
* Data types/structures
* Type inference

Usage
-----

Use the `lcpu` script in the `bin` directory:

``./bin/lcpu program.l``

It will print the generated assembly to standard output.

::

    lcpu [-p] [-c1] [-c2] [-c3] [-l] [-e] <program/expression>

    * -p: print the expanded program
    * -c1: print the code after the first compilation phase
    * -c2: print the code after the second compilation phase
    * -c3: print the code after the third compilation phase
    * -l: print the code after the linearization phase
    * -e: run an expression instead of a file

Examples
--------

You can see all the examples in the `examples <https://github.com/jlongster/dcpu-lisp/tree/master/examples>`_
directory.

Number Printing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code defines `print-number` which prints a number to the console::

    (define (print color bg-color x y text)
      (MUL y 32)
      (ADD y x)
      (ADD y 0x8000)
      (SHL color 12)
      (SHL bg-color 8)
      (BOR text color)
      (BOR text bg-color)
      (SET [y] text))

    (define (%print-number n i)
      (define (p n)
        (print 0xf 0 (- 31 i) 0 (+ 0x30 n)))

      (if (< n 10)
          (p n)
          (begin
            (p (% n 10))
            (%print-number (/ n 10) (+ i 1)))))

    (define (print-number n)
      (%print-number n 0))

    (print-number 12345)

Fib
~~~

Here is the fib program and the resulting assembly code (without the
runtime, which just provides a few helpful functions). You can get the
full assembly code in examples/fib.asm.

::

    (define (fib a)
      (if (<= a 1)
          1
          (+ (fib (- a 1))
             (fib (- a 2)))))
    
    ;; result will be in register J
    (fib 8)

::

    JSR global_dash_entry
    SET PC, __exit

    :global_dash_entry
    SET PUSH, return_dash_o1957346
    SET PUSH, 0x8
    SET PC, global_dash_entry_dash_fib
    :return_dash_o1957346
    SET PC, POP
    :global_dash_entry_dash_fib
    SET A, POP
    SET PUSH, A
    SET PUSH, return_dash_o3554470
    SET PUSH, A
    SET PUSH, 0x1
    SET PC, global_dash__lt__eq_
    :return_dash_o3554470
    SET A, POP
    IFE J, 0x0
    SET PC, alt_dash_o5960250
    SET J, 0x1
    SET PC, exit_dash_o9848488
    :alt_dash_o5960250
    SET PUSH, A
    SET PUSH, return_dash_o7693500
    SET PUSH, A
    SET PUSH, return_dash_o6022101
    SET J, A
    SUB J, 0x1
    SET PUSH, J
    SET PC, global_dash_entry_dash_fib
    :return_dash_o6022101
    SET A, POP
    SET PUSH, J
    SET PUSH, A
    SET PUSH, return_dash_o8008109
    SET J, A
    SUB J, 0x2
    SET PUSH, J
    SET PC, global_dash_entry_dash_fib
    :return_dash_o8008109
    SET A, POP
    SET PUSH, J
    SET PC, _plus_
    :return_dash_o7693500
    SET A, POP
    :exit_dash_o9848488
    SET PC, POP
    :__exit
    SET PC, __exit

You can also view the tests in the `tests` directory to see how
certain expressions are compiled.

Inline Assembly
---------------

If you want, you can code straight DCPU-16 assembly into your program.
For example, here is a function that prints values to the console::

    (define (print color bg-color x y text)
      (MUL y 32)
      (ADD y x)
      (ADD y 0x8000)
      (SHL color 12)
      (SHL bg-color 8)
      (BOR text color)
      (BOR text bg-color)
      (SET [y] text))

Dereferencing is supported with the normal bracket syntax (i.e. ``[y]``).

Macros
------

``define-macro`` is provided for defining macros::

    (define-macro (foo t x y)
      `(begin
         (define ,t (+ ,x ,y))
         (MUL ,t 50)))

    (foo z 1 2)

is converted into::

    (begin
      (define z (+ 1 2))
      (MUL z 50))

This is a powerful construct to make sure you can generate optimized assembly code.

Iteration
---------

The ``do`` construct provides iteration. There are two versions of ``do``::

    ;; Runs the expression with x starting at 0 and incrementing by 1
    ;; until it hits 32
    (do (x 0 32)
        (print (* x 20)))

    ;; Or you can provide your own start, stepping and stopping
    ;; expressions.
    ;; Here x starts as 0, is incremented by 5 and continues looping while
    ;; x is less than 100
    (do (x 0 (+ x 5) (< x 100))
        (print x)
        (print (/ x 2)))


Future work
-----------

* More optimizations
* A stepping-debugger

There are many more static optimizations we could do. I'm sure there
are bugs in this too, as it is rather untested. Please report issues
on github if you find any, or contact me at longster@gmail.com.
